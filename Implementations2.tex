The main failing of the SISR particle filter for tracking multiple targets is its inability to cope with high dimensionalities. This stems from the fact that a value for every state must be proposed for each particle at once, leading to high variance in the importance weights, poor particle diversity and ultimately poor tracking performance. An MCMC particle filter is able to cope with this
